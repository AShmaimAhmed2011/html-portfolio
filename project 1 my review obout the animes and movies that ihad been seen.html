<p>Movie; Maaveeran:<br>
Maaveran is a exceptional film in every aspect. Starting from the  terrific writing to every single<br> 
technical aspect it stands out. The most complicated screenplay in the recent times every scene looks<br>
very easy on screen but the way it is written with the events before and after the scenes were just<br>
brilliant. The realstic nature of the film is never given up even in a single scene with the whole <br>
films plot being fantasy is what the greatest achivement by ashwin and his team. The inner rage of a<br>
common man in the form  of a terrific voice over by vijay sethupathi makes maaveran a more amazing <br>
film. With enoromous hardwork only a film with this complicated screenplay can be shot. SK is at his<br>
best he has acted without the voice on the sets which was added later during the dubbing but the way <br>
he reacts and performs is just outstanding. Sarita mam just takes the screen through her presence<br>
everytime she appers. Mysskin as the antogonist is aptly casted for thr tinch of comic and aggrssion.<br>
Yogi babu's humour works out really well throughout the film. Aditi is not just a passing girlfriend <br>
she lends hands in the movement of the screenplay. The cinematographer has just nailed it with a<br>
complicated edit timeline the editor has perfectly cut the film with the layers added so perfectly. <br>
Music is apt and never over donr the boat sequence bgm will be talked about for sure.Action plays a <br>
very vital role and also a very unique and one of its kind not seen this kind of a action <br>
choregraphy atleast in any indian films recently. With all this packed perfectly ashwin also brings<br> 
in some really important political discussions which needs to be done so perfectly into the screenplay.<br>
Maaveran is a perfect example of a commercial flick with strong content.<br>
